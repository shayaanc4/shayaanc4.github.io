      <h2>Yours Truly: Signed or Unsigned?</h2>
      <p className="post-date">January 8, 2025</p>
      <p>
        When I first encountered signed and unsigned binary numbers, I
        underestimated how much of a headache they could be. Binary is just ones
        and zeros, right? How complicated could it get? But when you‚Äôre dealing
        with binary arithmetic in hardware descriptions languages (HDLs) like
        SystemVerilog, these distinctions become critical‚Äîand, frankly, a bit
        frustrating. This post is as much about sharing what I learned as it is
        about solidifying my own understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        In hardware design, unsigned binary numbers are straightforward‚Äîthey
        represent positive values starting from zero. Signed binary numbers,
        however, use two‚Äôs complement to encode negative numbers, which can make
        interpretation tricky. For example, what happens in SystemVerilog when
        you multiply a signed number by an unsigned number? This gets even more
        tricky if you don't manage the bit width of each number correctly. One
        of the bugs in my neural network accelerator project that took me the
        longest to fix arose because I was shifting a signed binary number with
        the "&gt;&gt;" operator, only to find out this doesn't preserve sign,
        and you're ACTUALLY supposed to use "&gt;&gt;&gt;".
      </p>
      <p>
        Now tack on handling fixed-point numbers with both integer and
        fractional parts, and suddenly you've got subtle arithmetic errors
        everywhere. Handling of these numbers requires not only great
        organization and modularity, but a way to benchmark whether the numbers
        you are getting are actually the ones you want. Now for this, if I went
        in and manually converted each signed fixed-point number to decimal
        manually, I would have never had time to write this post, so I looked to
        software. I was unable to find a function that encompassed signed and
        fractional numbers, so I wrote one myself, also in an effort to become
        even more comfortable with complex binary arithmetic and conversion. The
        task? Write a python function that takes in a signed, fractional (or
        integer) decimal number and produces its binary representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I broke the problem into steps. I needed to separate the integer
        and fractional parts of the number, convert each part to binary, and
        combine them. Here‚Äôs how I handled it:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Extract the integer and fractional parts using Python‚Äôs{" "}
        <code>int</code> and arithmetic operations.
        <br />
        2. Convert the integer part to binary with a fixed width using NumPy‚Äôs{" "}
        <code>binary_repr</code>.
        <br />
        3. Convert the fractional part iteratively by multiplying it by 2,
        extracting the integer bit, and repeating the process until the desired
        precision is reached.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I combined the two binary strings (integer and fractional) to form
        a complete binary representation of the number. For negative numbers, I
        applied two‚Äôs complement logic to ensure proper encoding.
      </p>
      <p>Here‚Äôs the final function:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`def binary_repr_frac(num, integer_width=3, precision=5):\n    total_width = integer_width + precision\n    integer_part = int(abs(num))\n    fractional_part = abs(num) - integer_part\n\n    integer_binary = np.binary_repr(integer_part, width=integer_width)\n\n    fractional_binary = ""\n    for _ in range(precision):\n        fractional_part *= 2\n        bit = int(fractional_part)\n        fractional_binary += str(bit)\n        fractional_part -= bit\n\n    combined_binary = f"{integer_binary}{fractional_binary}"\n\n    if num < 0:\n        combined_value = int(combined_binary, 2)\n        twos_complement_value = (1 << total_width) - combined_value\n        combined_binary = f"{twos_complement_value:0{total_width}b}"\n\n    return combined_binary`}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Writing this function was a great learning experience. It clarified my
        understanding of binary representation and fixed-point arithmetic, and
        it reinforced how critical precise conversions are in hardware design.
